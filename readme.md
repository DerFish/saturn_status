# What is this?
A small docker container setup for a flask-website, which displays the information of a Elegoo Saturn 3 Ultra in your network.

This is very basic. It's just for checking the printing status via a website on your home server. Nothing more.

## This is using https://github.com/vvuk/cassini. It's just a wrapper in flask and published via docker compose!
